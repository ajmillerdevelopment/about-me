# about-me
I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor's Degree in English. Originally, I intended to go to law school, but I put off applying due to the pandemic. During that time I decided, mostly on a whim, to try CodeAcademy. I've been a computer hobbyist all my life even though I never studied them academically, and I discovered that I enjoy programming. I pursued the self-education path for a while but decided that it was time to commit full-time to this career change, so I applied to General Assembly's full-time Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

I chose to pursue full-stack development as a career because I want a job where I use my creativity and knowledge to build things. I love the creative process and the sense of accomplishment that comes with putting something into the world. I also love learning, whether it be new technologies and techniques or more abstract concepts. I wanted a career where I can grow, learn, create, and build, and I believe that I've found that career in full-stack development.
